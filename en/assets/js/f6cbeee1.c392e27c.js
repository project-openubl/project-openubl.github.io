In addition, the endpoints are User Friendly, that is, the endpoints do not require cumbersome codes of Catalogs as the majority of software in the current national market.\\n\\nIf you want to contribute to the project you can do it in many ways:\\n\\n- Create or improve project documentation\\n- Create Github issues reporting errors or improvements\\n- Expand the news of the project"}]}')}}]);
